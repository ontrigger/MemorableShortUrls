# MemorableShortUrls
A URL shortener I made for my coursework with Django, Docker and Bootstrap

# Building
- Modify .env_template and copy it to .env
- Run docker-compose up

# TODO
- Make the design not garbage
- Get rid of bootstrap4django
- Properly configure the db url
- Remove difficult to remember words from the word dict
